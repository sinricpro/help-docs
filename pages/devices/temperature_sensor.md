Temperature sensor can detect the temperature surrounding area. Some temperature sensors has a humidity sensor built-in as well.

To create a Temperature/Humidity Sensor:

1. Log into your  [SinricPro](https://sinric.pro/) account.
2. Click on **Devices**.
3. Click on **Add Device**.
4. Enter the device name: **tempreature sensor** and description: **living room tempreature sensor**.
5. Select the device type as **Temperature Sensor**
6. Select the **Room** where the device is located.
5. Select the **Device Access Key**. This is the credential your IOT device must use when connecting to SinricPro. 
6. Click **Save**

That's it. 

If you have already linked the Amazon Alexa skill the app will show a popup in your mobile phone.

Cool!

Now let's complete the setup process. To do that, you must update the sample sketch with 
- WiFi credentials
- Copy the selected App key and App Secret in the Step 5 above.
- Copy the device's ID from Sinric -> Devices.
