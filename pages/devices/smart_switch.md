Smart Switch is a power plug that combines with WI-FI technology. 

To create a Smart Switch:

2. Click on **Devices**.
3. Click on **Add Device**.
4. Enter the device name: **switch** and eneter description: **tv switch**.
5. Select the device type as **Switch**
6. Select the **Room** where the device is located.
5. Select the **Device Access Key**. This is the credential your IOT device must use when connecting to SinricPro. 
6. Click **Save**

That's it. 

If you have already linked the Amazon Alexa skill the app will show a popup in your mobile phone.
