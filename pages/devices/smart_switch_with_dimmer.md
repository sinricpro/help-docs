Smart switch that has a built in dimming functionality

To create a Switch with dimmer:

1. Log into your  [SinricPro](https://sinric.pro/) account.
2. Click on **Devices**.
3. Click on **Add Device**.
4. Enter the device name: **lamp** and description: **living room lamp**.
5. Select the device type as **Switch with Dimming**
6. Select the **Room** where the device is located.
