**We provide the following services with our PaaS (White Label) solution**
 

### Mobile Apps

The Sinric Pro App for iOS and Android, rebranded to your own corporate custom branding and published on the AppStore and Google Play Store.

### Amazon Alexa Integration

We will setup an Amazon Alexa Skill for your own brand and publish it on Amazon Alexa Skill Store.

### Device Provisioning

The App supports device provisioning via BLE (for ESP32), ESPTouch/SmartAP (for ESP8266) and by a Captive Portal (WebUI).

You do not need to hardcode the app/security keys or device Ids — as this will be sent to your hardware module securely during the provisioning process.
 

### User Management, OTA

Using our Admin portal you can set up products, manage users, devices and perform OTA updates.

### Security

SSL encrypted communication between the cloud server, apps and ESP devices (for supported hardware) plus all the messages are signed and verified using Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) 


We also fully manage the server and maintain it — and your instance will receive free updates, bug fixes and features from the Sinric Pro master platform from time to time.

### Why shoud I use PaaS ?

* Accelerated time to the market. Your own branded apps and Alexa skill with in two weeks. 

* No need to deal with hiring iOS, Android, backend developers, dev-ops or purchase dedicated harware for them. 

* No need to maintain the code or keep libraries upto date. We will do it for you.

* Daily backups, scalability, security patches are managed by our experts.


### Why not:

* We will change only the App name, App icon and background color. No layout changes are permitted.

* SmartThings, Google Home, and IFTTT are not included. (Can be added)

* The server and app source code is not available to you.


### Other things
