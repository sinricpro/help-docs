In this section weâ€™ll walk through creating a **Temperature Sensor** using **ESP32**, **ESP8266** and then view the temperature via **Alexa, Google Home or SmartThings**.

### Prerequisites : 

1. ESP32, ESP8266 x 1.
2. DS18B20 or DS1822, DS1820, MAX31820, MAX31850 x 1.
3. 4.7k Ohm resistor x 1
4. Jumper Wires.

### Quick introduction to Temperature Sensor

The DS18B20 is a digital temperature sensor that communicates over a 1-Wire bus. It is a popular choice for many applications, including home automation, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation. The DS18B20 works by measuring the resistance of a thermistor. The thermistor is a semiconductor device whose resistance changes with temperature. The DS18B20 has a built-in 12-bit ADC that converts the thermistor's resistance to a digital value.

### Wiring

**If you are using the DS18B20, ground pins 1 and 3. The centre pin is the data line '1-wire'.** 

| MCU       | GPIO Pin     |
| --------- | ------- |
| ESP32     |    16   |
| ESP8266   |    14 (D5)    |

Let's verify that temperature is wired correctly and working.

Arduino IDE Serial Monitor will show the current temperature like this

### Step 1 : Create a new device in Sinric Pro

* [Login](http://portal.sinric.pro) to your Sinric Pro account, go to **Devices** menu on your left and click **Add Device** button (On top left).
* Enter the device name **Temperature Sensor**, description **My Temperature Sensor** and select the device type as **Temperature Sensor**.

![Sinric Pro create device alexa]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinric_pro_temperature_sensor_dht_tutorial_portal_new_device.png)

* Click **Next** the in the Notifications tab

You can set the threshold here to receive a push notification via the Sinric Pro app when the temperature goes **below** or **above** a certain temperature. Use the Retrigger Time to set the delay between notifications.

* Click Others tab and Click **Save**

* Next screen will show the credentials required to connect the device you just created.

* Copy the **Device Id**, **App Key** and **App Secret** ***Keep these values secure. DO NOT SHARE THEM ON PUBLIC FORUMS !***

### Step 2 : Connect to Sinric Pro 

#### Step 2.1 Install Sinric Pro Library

![Sinric Pro install SinricPro library]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinricpro_arduinoIDE-library-manager.png)

You can **generate the code** using **Zero Code** feature or write it by your self. If you do not have programming experice, we recommend to use Zero Code feature in the Portal to generate the code, download and flash.

#### 2.2 Complete Code

Now you should be able to view the temperature via Sinric Pro App

Please note that Google Home App shows the temperature sensor as a Thermostat due to Google Home limitations.

### Troubleshooting

1. error: DallasTemperature.h: No such file or directory

    **Solution**: Please make sure correct temperature library is installed. https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library

2. Reading invalid values like -127.00C, -196.60F, -127.00C, -196.60F

    **Solution**: Make sure you have wired correcrly or you do not have loose connection.
