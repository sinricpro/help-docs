title:  How to Build an Air Quality Sensor with an MQ135 Sensor
layout: post
---

In this section, we will walk you through creating an air quality sensor using **ESP32** or **ESP8266**. You will then be able to view the air quality via **Amazon Alexa** and **receive a push notification via the Sinric Pro** app when the air quality drops below a certain threshold level.

### Prerequisites : 

1. ESP32, ESP8266 x 1.
2. MQ135 x 1.
3. Jumper Wires.

### Quick introduction to MQ135

The MQ135 is a semiconductor gas sensor that is commonly used in air quality control equipment. It is sensitive to a wide range of gases, including ammonia, sulfide, benzene, and smoke. The sensor has two outputs: a digital output that goes high when the gas concentration exceeds a certain threshold, and an analog output that provides a voltage proportional to the gas concentration.

The MQ135 sensor requires a power supply of 5V and consumes about 150mA of current. The digital output can be connected to a ESP32, ESP8266 or Pico W to measure the gas concentration.

**How to calibrate the sensor ?**
Put your sensor outside where there is enough fresh air (ideally at 20Â°C & 33% humidity according to the datasheet) and leave it powered on for 12-24 hours to burn it in and stabilize.

### Wiring

![Sinric Pro esp8266 PIR wiring]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinricpro_mq135-wiring-diagram.png) 


| MCU       | A0 Pin                    |  VCC Pin  |
| --------- | -------                   | -------   |
| ESP32     |    34 (Analog ADC1_CH6)   |   5V      |
| ESP8266   |    A0                     |   5V/VIN  |
| Pico W    |    GP26 (ADC0)            |   5V      |
 


**Note:** on ESP32, ADC2 (GPIO04, GPIO02, GPIO15) is unstable when Wi-Fi is being used.

Let's verify that motion sensor is wired correctly and working.

Arduino IDE Serial Monitor will show the motion detections like this:

### Detecting poor Air Quality

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kakopappa/941db2518842c85b95a388592ad6cd3b.js"></script>

 
### Step 1 : Connect to Sinric Pro 

#### Step 1.1 : Creating a custom device type for Air Quality Sensor.

Sinric Pro does not have a built-in device type for Air Quality Sensor with PPM so we are going to create a custom device type for Water Sensor using Device Template feature to achieve.

1. PPM Value

2. Air Quality Is Severe, Very Poor, Poor, Moderate or Good. 

**Note**: You can use the device template import feature mentioned below to skip creating the full template.

* [Login](https://testportal.sinric.pro/devicetemplates/new) to your Sinric Pro account and goto **Device Templates**

* Click **Add Device Template**. Enter name and description as **Air Quality Sensor** and select **Air Quality Sensor** as device type

![Sinric Pro air quality ensor device template]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinricpro-air-quality-sensor-device-template-basic-info.png) 

* Click **Capabilities**. 

Here we must select the features of our Air Quality Sensor. We want to know whether *Air Quality* is *Severe, Very Poor, Poor, Moderate or Good*. So let's drag a **Range**, a **Mode** and **Push Notification** capability.

![Sinric Pro custom device type for capacitive soil moisture sensor]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/capacitive-air-quality-set-template-drop-range-mode.png) 

- What's Range capability?

  Range capability can be use to represents a number. eg: current speed of a blender.

- What's Mode capability?

  Mode capability can be use to represents a value out of list of predefined values. eg: current wash cycle mode of a washing machine.

- What's Push Notification capability?

  Notification capability provides the ability to send a push notification message from the code.

Click on **Configure** button and setup the two capabilities like below.

![Sinric Pro moisture sensor template mode and range settings]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinricpro-air-quality-device-template-range-and-mode.png)  

Click on **Save** to save.

![Sinric Pro moisture sensor template mode and range settings]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinricpro-air-quality-sensor-template-range-and-mode-configured.png)  

Click on **Save** to save the template.

Now you can see the template we just created.


## Import an existing template?

If you are feeling lazy setup all the Modes and Range values, you can use the import feature.

![Sinric Pro capacitive soil moisture sensor import template]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/capacitive-soil-moisture-sensor-import-template.png)

Paste this Template:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kakopappa/4c4b48081f5602f166e18f96dfa1b6bd.js"></script>

* [Login](http://portal.sinric.pro) to your Sinric Pro account, go to **Devices** menu on your left and click **Add Device** button (On top left).

* Enter the device name **Air Quality Sensor**, description **Air Quality Sensor** and select the device type as **Air Quality Sensor** from **Your Device Templates**.

![Sinric Pro create device alexa]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinricpro-air-quality-sensor-device-new-device-info.png)

* Click Others tab and Click **Save**

* Next screen will show the credentials required to connect the device you just created.

![Sinric Pro copy device id]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinric-pro-create-custom-device-keys.png)

* Copy the **Device Id**, **App Key** and **App Secret** ***Keep these values secure. DO NOT SHARE THEM ON PUBLIC FORUMS !***

* Click on **Code Generator** to Generate the code. Click on **Download** to download the code.

![Sinric Pro copy device id]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinric-pro-create-custom-device-code-download.png)
 

### Step 2 : Connect to Sinric Pro 

#### Step 2.1 Install Sinric Pro Library 

![Sinric Pro install SinricPro library]({{ site.github.url }}/public/img/sinricpro_arduinoIDE-library-manager.png)

#### Step 2.2 Install TroykaMQ

TroykaMQ is not available in Arduino Library Manager. So you must download it from [https://github.com/amperka/TroykaMQ](https://github.com/amperka/TroykaMQ) and copy it over to `C:\Users\<your username>\Documents\Arduino\libraries`

#### 2.2 Complete Code

 <script src="https://gist.github.com/kakopappa/462f5f2504edf04134265ce7999028c0.js"></script>
 
Now you should be able to see the flooding status and water level via Alexa, Sinric Pro App

Alexa, What's the air quality (mode name) in air quality sensor(device name)

Alexa, What's the ppm (range name) in air quality sensor(device name)
